# Roblox in Browser - now.gg Clone

## Overview
This is a static copy of now.gg's website for playing Roblox in the browser. It's designed to replicate the now.gg platform interface.

## Project Status
- **Date:** October 31, 2025
- **Status:** Website is set up and serving, but has functional limitations due to backend dependencies

## Recent Changes

### October 31, 2025

#### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Bug Fixes
1. **Fixed JavaScript syntax error in `index.html` (line 14)**
   - Corrected `language.indexOf("-" !== -1)` to `language.indexOf("-") !== -1`
   - This fixes language detection for locales like `en-US`, `fr-FR`, etc.

2. **Added missing favicon**
   - Copied favicon from `apps-content/common/img/favicon.ico` to `play/images/favicon.ico`
   - Resolves 404 errors for favicon requests

#### Phase 2: CORS Proxy Server Implementation
3. **Created Node.js/Express proxy server** (`server.js`)
   - Built production-ready CORS proxy to bypass same-origin restrictions
   - Features:
     - Express.js server with CORS middleware
     - Security headers using Helmet
     - Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes per IP)
     - Domain whitelisting (only now.gg domains allowed)
     - Comprehensive request/response logging
     - Error handling and validation

4. **Updated frontend to use proxy**
   - Modified `index.html` to route authentication requests through `/api/proxy`
   - Replaced failing `cors-bypass-app.herokuapp.com` service with local proxy
   - Updated fetch calls to use the local proxy endpoint

5. **Configured Node.js workflow**
   - Installed required packages: express, cors, helmet, express-rate-limit, http-proxy-middleware, node-fetch
   - Workflow now runs: `node server.js` instead of Python HTTP server
   - Server listens on port 5000 with proper binding to 0.0.0.0

## Proxy Server Details

### How It Works
The proxy server solves CORS issues by acting as an intermediary between the frontend and now.gg's API:

1. **Frontend Request**: Browser makes a request to `/api/proxy` with the target URL and data
2. **Proxy Processing**: Node.js server validates the domain, adds proper headers, and forwards the request
3. **API Response**: Server receives the response from now.gg and sends it back to the browser
4. **No CORS Errors**: Since the browser only communicates with the same origin (port 5000), CORS restrictions don't apply

### Proxy Endpoint
```
POST /api/proxy
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "https://now.gg/api/user/v2/auth?locale=en",
  "method": "POST",
  "body": { ... },
  "headers": { ... }
}
```

### Server Logs
The server logs all proxy requests including:
- Request URL and method
- Request body
- Response status
- Response data (first 200 characters)

Check workflow logs to debug authentication issues.

## Current Status and Limitations

### ✅ What's Working
- CORS proxy server successfully receives and forwards requests
- Frontend correctly sends authentication data through the proxy
- Static files and assets load without errors
- No more CORS blocking errors
- Server has proper security headers, rate limiting, and domain whitelisting

### ❌ What's Not Working
- **now.gg API returns 404 errors** when accessed from the proxy
- The authentication endpoint (`https://now.gg/api/user/v2/auth`) is either:
  - Not publicly accessible
  - Requires additional authentication headers/tokens
  - Has been moved or deprecated
  - Blocks requests from non-now.gg domains at the API level

### Why Game Loading Fails
The website shows "Something went wrong" because:
1. Frontend sends authentication request to `/api/proxy` ✅
2. Proxy forwards request to `https://now.gg/api/user/v2/auth` ✅
3. now.gg API returns HTML 404 page instead of auth token ❌
4. Frontend can't proceed without valid authentication response ❌

## Next Steps for Full Functionality

To make the game actually load, one of these approaches is needed:

### Option 1: Obtain Valid API Access
- Partner with now.gg or obtain API credentials
- Reverse-engineer the complete authentication flow from the official site
- May require additional headers, tokens, or API keys not present in the static files

### Option 2: Build Alternative Backend
- Implement your own cloud gaming infrastructure
- Host Android emulators for Roblox
- Build streaming protocol (WebRTC or similar)
- This is a massive undertaking equivalent to rebuilding now.gg

### Option 3: Static Demo Only
- Accept that full game functionality won't work
- Use as UI/UX demonstration
- Display error message explaining technical limitations
- Focus on the interface design rather than functionality

## Project Architecture

### File Structure
- `/` - Root HTML files (index.html, aboutus.html, blog.html, etc.)
- `/play/` - Game player application files (React-based)
- `/apps/` - App-specific HTML pages
- `/apps-content/` - Game assets (images, logos, banners)
- `/images/` - Additional image assets
- `/_next/` - Pre-built Next.js static files

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- React (for game player interface in `/play/`)
- Next.js (pre-built static export)
- Google Tag Manager for analytics
- Prebid.js for ad management

**Backend (New):**
- Node.js 20
- Express.js - Web server framework
- cors - CORS middleware
- helmet - Security headers
- express-rate-limit - Rate limiting protection
- http-proxy-middleware - Proxy utilities
- node-fetch - HTTP client for API requests

### New Files
- `server.js` - Main proxy server implementation
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies (auto-generated)
- `node_modules/` - Installed packages

## Running the Project

The website runs automatically via the `web-server` workflow:
```bash
node server.js
```

**Server Details:**
- Port: 5000
- Binding: 0.0.0.0 (accessible from Replit webview)
- Health check: `http://localhost:5000/health`
- Proxy endpoint: `http://localhost:5000/api/proxy`

The site is accessible at the Replit webview URL on port 5000.

**Checking Logs:**
View workflow logs in the Replit interface to see:
- Server startup messages
- Proxy request/response details
- Error messages and debugging information
